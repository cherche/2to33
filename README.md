# 2^33
A 3D version of 2048.

Based on [2048 by Gabriele Cirulli](https://play2048.co), which is based on [1024 by Veewo Studio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1024!/id823499224) and conceptually similar to [Threes by Asher Vollmer](http://asherv.com/threes/), and conceptually similar to [other](https://joppi.github.io/2048-3D/) [higher-dimensional](http://kshitij-banerjee.github.io/Cubiks-2048/) [2048-like](https://huonw.github.io/2048-4D/) [games](https://maigoakisame.github.io/2048-4D/). What a mouthful.
